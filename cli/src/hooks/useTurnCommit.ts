/**
 * Tracks conversation turn boundaries and maintains a commit watermark.
 *
 * Messages before the watermark are immutable → safe for <Static> (print-once).
 * Messages after the watermark are live → rendered in Ink's dynamic region,
 * re-rendering on every state change (card status updates, body streaming, etc).
 *
 * The watermark advances when a NEW turn starts (inactive → active). At that point,
 * all previous cards are resolved (user responded, card auto-approved, etc.) and the
 * new API call has begun. This ensures interactive cards (e.g., plan_mode_respond,
 * ask_followup_question) remain in the dynamic region while awaiting user input.
 *
 * For task completion (no next turn), the watermark advances when the task status
 * is COMPLETED and there is no active turn.
